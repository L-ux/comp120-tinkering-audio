### Contract 3 - Josh Grillo
The contract I have chosen is the procedural melody generation. Some things I believe will be beneficial to working are:
* I will start by creating a table that holds each note, and some data structure which holds possible notes that can be chosen after. 
* I will create a structure that contains different parts of the song... Intro, Verse, Chorus, Bridge, Outro.
	* The order of the song will be mostly defined, but may choose on having a second Verse&Chorus etc
*
